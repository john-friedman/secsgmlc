These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws. </span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:27.74pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Identifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer products) and implement appropriate changes.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:27.74pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:27.74pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Security events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact. </span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:27.74pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation strategies.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:27.74pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and compliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2025, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:27.74pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers and potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing our employee, business or customer data. In addition to new vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity compromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:27.74pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the heading &#8220;Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences&#8221; included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</span></div><span></span>
